## Space Hotel
Telon Usk's newest venture, the Space Hotel. 

You will be creating the hotel reservation system for the guests. You should come up with some questions that you want to put to the representatives of Cozmoz to find out what it is that they need the system to do. You should consider all the stakeholders in this process to ensure that all bases are covered.

### Stakeholders
* The team working on it, Investors, Hotels/Restaurants/Flight companies etc
* Owner of Cozmoz, Telon Usk
* The end-users: guests to the hotel, hotel staff

### Gathering Information
For Cozmoz: 
* Who are the end-users?
* What are the payment acceptance criteria?
* What is the maximum capacity of the hotel?
* How will the UI reflect your brand image?
* What other features do you want to include?
* What are the different levels of access for different end-users?
* What data about the customer should be stored in the system?
* Do you prefer security over speed?

For engineers: 
* Is there a pre-existing system? 
* Could there be any conflicts 


### Requirements
* A way for the customer to enter the necessary information (credit card information, passport, payment choice, name, medical record)
* A way of verifying the passport, credit card and seeing if they have any medical problems, hindering them from accessing space
* A way of certifying that the person can withstand the G forces of the rocket
* A way of getting the money from their account to the booking’s account
* A protocol that doesn’t let the website be open for too long
Backend database that securely stores all customer information
* System inputs are sanitised for security

### Tooling
